# What is this

Fun project..? where little robots in ROS2 are able to reach goal locations in a 2D grid world by creating bridges. Hopefully.

I made a [template](https://github.com/lemonlemonde/gazebo-ros2-docker-template) that this is built on. 

## Dependencies
There are some git submodules, and they should all be working, but if at any time need to update them...

```shell
git submodule update --remote --merge
```
